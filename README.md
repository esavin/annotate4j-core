# annotate4j-core
The small library to process binary files annotated with compact set of annotations.

The main ideas: it is possible to describe most of binary formats with the limited number of format independent annotations and  
Java language standard data types. After that it is possible to use the abstract mechanism to load described binary files
in the memory by very common format indenpendent loader provided in this project.
